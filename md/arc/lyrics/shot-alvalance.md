'm riding shotgun down the avalanche
Tumbling and falling down the avalanche


So be quiet tonight the stars
Shine bright
On this mountain of new fallen snow
But I will raise up my voice into
The void
You have left me nowhere to go


I love you so much and it's so bizarre
A mystery that goes on and on and on
This is the best thing and the very
Most hard
And we don't get along


After countless appeals we keep
Spinning our wheels
On this mountain of new fallen snow
So I let go the catch and we are
Over the edge
You have left me nowhere to go


I'm riding shotgun down the avalanche

Sometimes you make me lose my will
To live
And just become a beacon for your soul
But the past is stronger than my will
To forgive
Forgive you or myself, I don't know


I'm riding shotgun down the avalanche
Tumbling and falling down the avalanche


So be quiet tonight be sure to
Step lightly
On this mountain of new fallen snow
But I will raise up my voice into
The void
You have left me nowhere to go
