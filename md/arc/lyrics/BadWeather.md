In every day that passes us by
I can't help the feelin' that you and I
We won't get to see another day together
Looks like bad weather

I can see it all there in your eyes
And it comes to me as no surprise
That you don't need me here no more
Your feeling tells the score

Words, they are getting
Hard for me to find
You take me by my hand
And you're leading me blind

In every day that passes us by
I can't help the feelin' that you and I
We won't get to see another day together
Looks like bad weather

Yes, it does
And I believe it's gonna rain
