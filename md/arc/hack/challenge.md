## Solve a major problem that achieves high impact: 
    
Custom Challenge Programs focus on high-value targets and often aim to tackle serious market failures or remove barriers
or bottlenecks that may be holding up progress in a certain area or industry.

## Tackle complex problems: 
    
Challenge programs can be structured in stages, consisting of many incremental Challenges that guide the innovation 
community toward systematically tackling the overall problem.

## Build and develop an innovation community: 

Custom Challenge Programs seek to improve the innovation system within a given sector by providing a forum and focus 
for a solver community, fostering collaboration, cooperation, and networking among innovators and other key stakeholders, 
and improving information-sharing, knowledge transfer, and communication within the community.

## Source new ideas from unexpected fields: 
    
Because Custom Challenge Programs tend to demand radical thinking and breakthrough innovations, it is especially 
important to attract new and original ideas from outside traditional sectors. These programs often make an extra 
effort to engage new innovators and offer sub-prizes that reward technology-transfer from external sectors.

## Draw attention to the problem: 
    
Exposing a problem or Challenge to the world, and offering a sizeable reward (typically $100,000 or more) to 
individuals/groups which can address or even solve the problem, is an effective way to raise awareness about an issue.

## Promote your brand and cause: 
    
Launching a Custom Challenge Program can raise the profile of the program sponsor and its cause, helping to establish 
thought leadership within an industry or around an important issue. And for foundations, these programs are effective 
fund raising vehicles.

## Create new markets: 
    
Custom Challenge Programs can be used to open up whole new markets or new areas of innovation, as radical advances open 
up fresh avenues of commercial opportunity and enable a diverse range of sequential innovations.

## Maximize return-on-investment (ROI): 

Custom Challenge Programs aim to maximize returns from the sponsorâ€™s financial investment, as well as reduce their risk, 
since solvers collectively invest considerable sums in pursuit of the prize.
