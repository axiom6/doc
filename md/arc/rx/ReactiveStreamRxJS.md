# Reactive Streams with RxJS

Data Science employs techniques from many fields that are so numerous that they make your head hurt.
So wouldn't be nice if there was a way for all these techniques to share their data and intent. 
The awswer is reactive streams that govern streams of data, especially “live” data with a publish
and subscribe approach that promotes data interaction while allowing the techniques to remain decoupled.

Reactive streams operate at many levels: in the browser with RxJS, on the server with RxJava and in big data with Apache Spark streaming. 

So to introduce reactive streams in a lightning talk I will demonstrate RxJS in the browser with a Leaflet GIS application, since GIS constantly wrestles with the interaction of spatial and thematic data. Moreover I will show how to strean in interactive intent. 

application to visualize the inter-operability of spatial an thematic data with user intent.  






"Data science is, in general terms, the extraction of knowledge from data.[1] [2] It employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the broad areas of mathematics, statistics, and information technology, including signal processing, probability models, machine learning, statistical learning, computer programming, data engineering, pattern recognition and learning, visualization, uncertainty modeling, data warehousing, and high performance computing." - Wikipedia

"A geographic information system (GIS) lets us visualize, question, analyze, and interpret data to understand relationships, patterns, and trends" - ESRI

With HTML5 the browers

In this talk I will show how RxJS synchornizes the user's interactive intent with the
spatial and thematic data in GIS
