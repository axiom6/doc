In 2006, the IEEE Conference on Data Mining identified 10 top algorithms [Ref: http://www.cs.uvm.edu/~icdm/algo... ]. Are these still valid? Are there new algorithms that have found sweet spots in the industry?

Those top-10 algorithms for reference:

    C4.5
    k-Means
    Support Vector Machines (SVM)
    Apriori
    Expectation Maximization (EM)
    PageRank
    AdaBoost
    k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
    Naive Bayes
    Classification and Regression Tree (CART)
