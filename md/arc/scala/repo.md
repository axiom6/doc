Platform / package manager ranking: 1. NodeJS/NPM 2. Clojure/Leiningen 3. Ruby/Gems 4. Grails/Plugins 5. Java/Maven 6. Scala/Activator/SBT

Take the low 6. Scala/Activator/SBT ranking seriously @Typesafe because until you do the myth that Scala is hard will not change

@TheTomFlaherty Thanks for the honest feedback. What were your challenges? What can we make better?

@_JamesWard Two many repos .m2(Maven) .ivy2 activator. Pick .m2 & get inspired by Clojure/Leiningen that avoids setting your hair on fire

@_JamesWard NodeJS/NPM secret is that older packages can live under parents. Daunting for deeply compiled langs (Scala), but worth exploring

@_JamesWard Continue your fine work by having Activator & SBT follow the same conventions. Activator should be SBT light for getting started


@_JamesWard Finally I look forward seeing you at Reactive ... Denver http://bit.ly/1ibJdCR  To prep I will put my recommendations in my blog

@TheTomFlaherty The sense I get is that npm succeeds because it's the first with a unified vision that included the repository maintainers.

@TheTomFlaherty The formation of Java repositories involved a lot of people talking past each other and/or one upping.


@mojavelinux @_JamesWard Agreed. NPM's unified repo is an inspiration for JVM/Maven/.m2 Hope it can be saved. If not use Activator's repo
