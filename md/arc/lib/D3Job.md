om, I noticed you're also in the D3.js DataViz meetup... A cybersecurity visualization project just fell in my lap from DC and I need to find a data visualization co-worker (preferably familiar with D3). It's a 3mo project, 40hrs/wk and pays really well. Any chance you might know of someone that's available for the next few months? Happy to share more tonight at the HMTL5 meetup if you'd like. Jamison jmday@ecosify.com 812.320.4009
