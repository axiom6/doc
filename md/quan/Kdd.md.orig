- Identify the goal of the KDD process from the customerâ€™s perspective.
- Understand application domains involved and the knowledge that's required
- Select a target data set or subset of data samples on which discovery is be performed.
- Cleanse and preprocess data by deciding strategies to handle missing fields and alter the data as per the requirements.
- Simplify the data sets by removing unwanted variables. Then, analyze useful features that can be used to represent the data, depending on the goal or task.
- Match KDD goals with data mining methods to suggest hidden patterns.
- Choose data mining algorithms to discover hidden patterns. This process includes deciding which models and parameters might be appropriate for the overall KDD process.
- Search for patterns of interest in a particular representational form, which include classification rules or trees, regression and clustering.
- Interpret essential knowledge from the mined patterns.
- Use the knowledge and incorporate it into another system for further action.
- Document it and make reports for interested parties.

###

- Data cleaning to remove noise and inconsistent data.
- Data integration, where multiple data sources may be combined.
- Data selection, where data relevant to the analysis task are retrieved from the database.
-Data transformation, where data are transformed and consolidated into forms appropriate for mining by preforming summary or aggregation operations.
- Data mining, which is an essential process where intelligent methods are applied to extract data patterns.
- Pattern evaluation to identify the truly interesting patterns representing knowledge based on interesting measures.
- Knowledge presentation, where visualization and knowledge representation techniques are used to present mined knowledge to users.

###


    Step 1: Selection (data into target data)
    Step 2: Preprocessing (target data into processed data)
    Step 3: Transformation (processed data into transformed data)
    Step 4: Data Mining (transformed data into patterns)
    Step 5: Interpretation and/or Evaluation patterns into knowledge)
