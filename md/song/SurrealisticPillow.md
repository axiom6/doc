## She Has Funny Cars (Balin, Kaukonen) - 3:13    
    
Every day I try so hard to know your mind      
And find out what's inside you    
Time goes on and I don't know just where you are  
Or how I'm going to find you  
  
You can do whatever you please  
The world's waiting to be seized  
You can collect all neglect  
Or all the self-respect you need, what you need  
  
And I know... and I know... and I know  
  
Your mind's guaranteed  
It's all you'll ever need  
So what do you want with me?  
  
We live but once  
But good things can be found around  
In spite of all the sorrow  
  
If you see black  
You can't look back  
You can't look front  
You cannot face tomorrow  
  
Some have it nice  
Fat and round, flash, paradise  
They're very wise to their disguise  
Trying to revolutionize tomorrow  
  
And I know... and I know... and I know  
  
Your mind's guaranteed  
It's all you'll ever need  
So what do you want with me?  
  
## Somebody to Love (Slick, Slick) - 3:01  
When the truth is found to be lies  
And all the joys within you dies  
Don't you want somebody to love  
Don't you need somebody to love  
Wouldn't you love somebody to love  
You better find somebody to love  
  
When the garden flowers baby are dead yes  
And your mind is full of red  
Don't you want somebody to love  
Don't you need somebody to love  
Wouldn't you love somebody to love  
You better find somebody to love  
  
Your eyes, I say your eyes may look like his  
But in your head baby I'm afraid you don't know where it is  
Don't you want somebody to love  
Don't you need somebody to love  
Wouldn't you love somebody to love  
You better find somebody to love  
  
Tears are running ah running down your breast  
And your friends baby they treat you like a guest  
Don't you want somebody to love  
Don't you need somebody to love  
Wouldn't you love somebody to love  
You better find somebody to love  
  
## My Best Friend (Spence) - 3:04
  
Ah, you're my best friend  
(You are my best friend)  
And I love you so well  
Till the end of time you won't see me  
Ah, you're my best friend  
(You are my best friend)  
When I see you, it seems  
Now I can see I've fallen into your love stream  
I follow your dream  
Do you know what I mean, yeah  
I follow you wherever time will take me to  
Forever I'll be one with you  
One with you  
One with you  
  
Ah, you're my best friend  
(You are my best friend)  
And I saw that you're seein'  
I'll set you free and just like me you'll be bein'  
In love with me  
Do you know what I mean, yeah  
Do you know what I mean now  
(Do you know what I mean)  
I'm gonna set you free now  
(Do you know)  
You'll be in love with me  
(Do you know what I mean)  
You're my best friend now  
  
Ah, you're my best friend  
(You are my best friend)  
And I love you so well  
Till the end of time you won't see me  
Ah, you're my best friend  
(You are my best friend)  
When I see you, it seems  
Now I can see I've fallen into your love stream  
I follow your dream  
Do you know what I mean, yeah  
Do you know what I mean now  
(Do you know what I mean)  
You'll be in love with me now  
(Do you know)  
I'm gonna set you free, yeah  
(What I mean)  
Oh you're my best friend now  
  
Ah, you're my best friend  

## Today (Balin, Kantner) - 3:02  

Today I feel like pleasing you more than before  
Today I know what I want to do but I don't know what for  
To be living for you is all I want to do  
To be loving you it'll all be there when my dreams come true  
Today you'll make me say that I somehow have changed  
Today you'll look into my eyes, I'm just not the same  
To be anymore than all I am would be a lie  
I'm so full of love I could burst apart and start to cry  
Today everything you want, I swear it all will come true  
Today I realize how much I'm in love with you  
With you standing here I could tell the world what it means to love  
To go on from here I can't use words, they don't say enought  
Please, please listen to me  
It's taken so long to come true  
And it's all for you  
All for you....  

## Comin' Back to Me (Balin) - 5:24  

The summer had inhaled  
And held its breath too long.  
The winter looked the same,  
As if it had never gone,  
And through an open window,  
Where no curtain hung,  
I saw you, I saw you,  
Coming back to me.  
  
One begins to read between  
The pages of a look.  
The sound of sleepy music,  
And suddenly, you're hooked.  
I saw you, I saw you,  
Coming back to me.  
  
You came to stay and live my way,  
Scatter my love like leaves in the wind.  
You always say that you won't go away,  
But I know what it always has been,  
It always has been.  
  
A transparent dream  
Beneath an occasional sigh...  
Most of the time,  
I just let it go by.  
Now I wish it hadn't begun.  
I saw you, I saw you,  
Coming back to me.  
  
Strolling the hill,  
Overlooking the shore,  
I realize I've been here before.  
The shadow in the mist  
Could have been anyone--  
I saw you, I saw you,  
Coming back to me.  
  
Small things like reasons  
Are put in a jar.  
Whatever happened to wishes,  
Wished on a star?  
Was it just something  
That I made up for fun?  
I saw you, I saw you,  
Coming back to me.  

## 3/5 of a Mile in 10 Seconds (Balin) - 3:45  

Do away with people blowing my mind  
Do away with people wasting my precious time  
Take me to a simple place  
Where I can easily see my face  
Baby, baby I can see that you're fine  
Know I love you baby, yes I do  
Know I love you baby, yes I do  
  
Do away with people laughing at my hair  
Do away with people climbing on my precious prayers  
Take me to a circus tent  
Where I can easily pay my rent  
And all the other freaks can share my cares  
Know I love you baby, yes I do  
Know I love you baby, yes I do  
  
Do away with things that come on obscene  
Like hot rods real clean real fine nicotine  
Sometimes the price is 65 dollars  
Prices like that make a grown man holler  
'specially when it's sold by a kid that's only 15  
Know I love you baby, yes I do  
Know I love you baby, yes I do  
3/5's of a mile in 10 seconds...  

## D.C.B.A. - 25 (Kantner) - 2:39  

It's time you walked away and set me free--  
I must move away, 'n' leave you be.  
It has been good to us my friend,  
Wait, and see how it will end.  
We come and go as we please.  
(Grace: We come and go as we please)  
(Paul: That's how it has to be).  
  
Here in this ocean, the near and holy,  
Too many days I've left unstoned.  
If you don't mind, happiness  
Purple pleasure-fields in the sun  
Ah don't you know I'm runnin' home  
(Grace: Don't you know I'm runnin' home)  
(Paul: To a place, for you unknown).  
  
I take great peace in your sitting there(1).  
Searching for myself, I find a place there(2).  
I see the people of the world,  
Where they are and what they could be.  
I can but dance behind your smile  
(Grace: I can but dance behind your smile)  
(Paul: To [the] other world---to me, for a while)  

## How Do You Feel (Mastin) - 3:34  

Look into her eyes  
Do you see what I mean  
Just look at her hair  
And when she speaks, oh what a pleasant surprise  
  
How do you feel  
Just look at her smile  
Do you see what I mean  
She is looking our way  
Oh how I wish we could stay, just stay for a while  
How do you feel  
  
When I meet a girl like that  
I don't know what to say  
But to meet a girl like that  
Brightens up my day  
My day, oh  
How do you feel  
  
Just look at her walk  
Do you see what I mean  
She is coming our way  
Oh, how my heart beats, I don't even think I can talk  
How do you feel  
  
When I meet a girl like that  
I don't know what to say  
But to meet a girl like that  
Brightens up my day  
My day, oh  
How do you feel  
  
How do you feel  
Do you know how you feel  
Just look at her smile  
(Tell me how do you feel)  
Look into her eyes  
(Tell me how do you feel)  
She is coming our way  
(Tell me how do you feel)  
Look into her eye  
(Tell me how do you feel)  
She is coming our way  
(Tell me how do you feel)

## White Rabbit (Slick) - 2:33  

One pill makes you larger  
And one pill makes you small,  
And the ones that mother gives you  
Don't do anything at all.  
Go ask Alice  
When she's ten feet tall.  
And if you go chasing rabbits  
And you know you're going to fall,  
Tell 'em a hookah smoking caterpillar  
Has given you the call.  
Call Alice  
When she was just small.  
When the men on the chessboard  
Get up and tell you where to go  
And you've just had some kind of mushroom  
And your mind is moving low.  
Go ask Alice  
I think she'll know.  
When logic and proportion  
Have fallen sloppy dead,  
And the White Knight is talking backwards  
And the Red Queen's "off with her head!"  
Remember what the dormouse said:  
"Feed your head. Feed your head. Feed your head"  
Plastic Fantastic Lover (Balin) - 2:40  
Her neon mouth with the blinkers-off smile  
Nothing but an electric sign  
You could say she has an individual style  
She's part of a colorful time  
  
Secrecy of lady-chrome-covered clothes  
You wear cause you have no other  
But I suppose no one knows  
You're my plastic fantastic lover  
  
Her rattlin' cough never shuts off  
Is nothin' but a used machine  
Her aluminum finish, slightly diminished  
Is the best I ever have seen  
  
Secrecy of lady-chrome-covered clothes  
You wear cause you have no other  
I realize no one's wise  
To my plastic fantastic lover  
  
The electrical dust is starting to rust  
Her trapezoid thermometer taste  
All the red tape is mechanical rape  
Of the TV program waste  
  
Data control and IBM  
Science is mankind's brother  
But all I see is drainin' me  
On my plastic fantastic lover
