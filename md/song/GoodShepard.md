If you want to get to heaven
Over on the other shore
Stay out of the way of the blood-stained bandit
Oh good shepherd
Feed my sheep
One for Paul
One for Silas
One for to make my heart rejoice
Can't you hear my lambs acallin
Oh good shepherd
Feed my sheep
If you want to get to heaven
Over on the other shore
Stay out of the way of the long-tongue liar
Oh good shepherd
Feed my sheep
If you want to get to heaven
Over on the other shore
Stay out of the way of the gun shot devil
Oh good shepherd
Feed my sheep

Good Shepherd – Jefferson Airplane
At the pinnacle of their career in 1969, Jefferson Airplane recorded an obscure spiritual that became a standout track on Volunteers. It combines folk guitar strumming with Jorma Kaukonen’s razor-sharp lead guitar work. He also gives a tender vocal performance. At the time it may have had a hippie-communal vibe, but it’s done so reverently that it remains a spiritual song.

One can only wonder how it came to be recorded. It’s interesting to note that Kaukonen has long-explored American roots music, which includes gospel influences. In 2007 he released Stars in My Crown, a collection containing many old gospel songs. This followed the Grammy-nominated Blue Country Heart that came out five years earlier. This journey may have started in earnest when Kaukonen and Airplane bass player Jack Casady became the nucleus of Hot Tuna. Songs like "True Religion" show their interest in roots and gospel music.

It’s no accident that Kaukonen and Casady ended up together. They were the two most accomplished musicians from Jefferson Airplane. You can see the chemistry that they still have together on a "Good Shepherd" performance posted on YouTube. Their ability to improvise with each other takes the song to another level.

What initially drew me to the song is a combination of plaintive melody, understated vocals, blistering lead guitar solos and beautiful background vocals by Grace Slick and Paul Kantner.

I see such longing and beauty in the first two lines:

If you want to get to heaven
Over on the other shore

Arriving in heaven has sometimes been pictured as washing up on another shore. It reminds me of the sweaters that Irish wives would knit for their husbands to wear on treacherous fishing expeditions. Each sweater contained knots distinctive to a particular family that were woven into the fabric. When men were swept overboard and drowned, the decomposed bodies that later washed up could be identified by the family sweater. When this life has finally taken the ultimate toll, those who have believed will wash up on that other shore, where immediately they will be recognized by their relationship to Christ. For those who trust in Him, have put on Christ.

The third line completes a basic simple structure that is repeated throughout the song. The first two lines are always the same with a slight variation occurring at the end of the third line. We are warned successively to stay out of the way of the bloodstained bandit, the long-tongue liar and the gun shot devil.

Stay out of the way of the …

The words "stay out of the way" call to mind the words of Psalm 1, which speaks of the joy of the one that avoids the way of sinners.

Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked,
Nor stands in the way of sinners,
Nor seats in the seat of scoffers

We would be wise to heed the words of the song and stay out of the way epitomized by the shady characters mentioned.

Each stanza is followed by the chorus, which is an appeal for God to feed the sheep.

Oh good shepherd
Feed my sheep

Mention is made of Paul and Silas—two of the first missionaries of the early Church.

One for Paul
One for Silas
One for to make my heart rejoice

The writer also asks "one for to make my heart rejoice." Later, the line changes at the end to "one for to make my life complete."

There’s nothing quite like the joy of leading someone into a relationship with Jesus Christ. If you are a Christian, you probably have discovered that just talking with someone about how they can come to know God brings a unique satisfaction.

The Scriptures teach that heaven rejoices when one person turns to God. If we lead someone to Christ, we have participated in a process that results in all of that person’s sins being forgiven. We feel a little of the joy of heaven because we have aligned ourselves with God’s purposes. Jesus came to seek and save the lost, and He bids us to join Him in that work.

God equips some of his followers to be shepherds of His sheep. He gifts them for this task, but we all can play a part by using the gifts we’ve been given to help each other grow spiritually.

As humans, we can only do so much for other people. Leaders are in position where they recognize how inadequate they are to meet the needs of others. They realize how much they need God’s help. Their desire may be reflected in the lines of the chorus.

Can’t you hear my lambs a callin’?
Oh good shepherd
Feed my sheep

One man who hungered more than most for the Good Shepherd to feed his flock was Robert Murray McCheyne. As a young minister in Scotland, he was oppressed by the fact that despite his best efforts, his work was not flourishing. Sadly, frail health led to an early death. His ministry lasted only seven years, but it’s impact throughout the world lasts to this day.

A man who served under McCheyne revealed his secret to a young minister who visited McCheyne’s old church.

"Sit down here," said the sexton, motioning his visitor to the chair in which McCheyne had so often sat.

"Now, put your elbows on the table! That was the way Mr. McCheyne used to do!"

The visitor obeyed.

"Now, put your face in your hands!" The visitor did so.

"Now let the tears flow! That was the way Mr. McCheyne used to do!"

The sexton led his guest to the pulpit; and gave him a fresh series of instructions.

"Put your elbows down into the pulpit!" He put his elbows down.

"Now put your face in your hands!" He did so.

"Now let the tears flow! That was the way Mr. McCheyne used to do!"

McCheyne had not only a passion for God, but also a passion for people. His tears were the outpouring of his heart. God responded to his prayers by reviving the people of Scotland.

McCheyne’s heart is but a dim reflection of the heart of the great Shepherd of the sheep. How much greater is God’s compassion? How much deeper than any human love is God’s love? How much more eager God is to fulfill, than we are to carry out, the command, "Feed my sheep."

Before I came to know Christ, I never realized the spiritual implications of this song. I was drawn by the music. I can see now that the lyrics point to the reality of God’s goodness. He draws lost sheep like me to Himself and then cares for them. He provides shepherds to teach me His ways. They help me to learn how to appropriate God’s bountiful resources for myself. Regardless of my progress, my attitude towards them and other Christians should always be one of humility.

I’m thankful that God helps me to avoid the way that would make my journey more perilous. If I travel the way of the Godless, I will stumble and suffer for it. No, I want to walk in God’s ways.

When I do fail, He uses my mistakes and the hardships in life to break me down so that I become more like Him. It makes me look forward even more to heaven. When I wash up on the other shore, I may be so badly disfigured that the angels may wonder who I am. At that point, I can see the Father rising to say, "He is one of mine. I recognize the clothing of my Son."

The Power of Hope - Mark Buckley
The Power of Hope                               April 2013

Though most of his family died under the demonic persecution of the Nazis, Elie Wiesel survived the Holocaust. Elie went on to win the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to turn the world from a place of hatred into a realm of righteousness. Viktor Frankl, a Viennese psychiatrist before World War II, survived Auschwitz. Years later he wrote the book, Man’s Search for Meaning. In the concentration camp he discovered that the prisoners who often survived were not the ones who were strongest physically, but the ones who had hope. Hope is one of the most essential, but least valued attributes of a healthy person.

Jesus said in the last days wickedness would increase and the love of most people would grow cold. (Matt.

Crazy for God - David C.
David is a friend with mental illness. I wrote the following using his previous writings and personal knowledge. 

Crazy for God! You may laugh or think me foolish, but since 1977 I have been mentally ill.  It’s a stigma I often bear, but Christ has turned it into a badge of honor. I don’t have to be ashamed. Mental illness is not a moral failure.

It was a trait that I inherited, and my home life was far from ideal. I witnessed promiscuity; my dad took me to an x-rated movie when I was only 16.

God deals bountifully - Charles R. Swindoll
I read something by Charles R. Swindoll the other day that encouraged me. You have probably heard some of it before, but it's a good reminder. 

"We must recognize that God uses trials to transform us, not our surroundings. God wishes to train us, to mold us. He uses the distressing circumstances brought on by evil to benefit us rather than destroy us. The evils intended by the world become His tools. In doing so, He deals bountifully with us ... deep within where no one else can see or touch.

Potters and Hedgerows - C. H. Spurgeon
For all who labor at what may seem lowly, be encouraged by Charles Spurgeon from Morning and Evening (June 3):

“These were potters, and those that dwelt among plants and hedges: there they dwelt with the king for his work.”

— 1 Chronicles 4:23

Potters were not the very highest grade of workers, but “the king” needed potters, and therefore they were in royal service, although the material upon which they worked was nothing but clay.

The Horse and Her Boy - David Roper
David Roper is a favorite author. He writes for Our Daily Bread and his latest involves a boyhood memory of a horse. You can see the original post at http://odb.org/2011/12/14/the-horse-and-her-boy/ or read it below.

When I was about 5 years old, my father decided that I needed a horse of my own to care for. So he bought an old bay mare and brought her home to me. I named her Dixie.

Dixie was a formidable beast for me at my age and small stature.

Distracting Judgments
“With some mental work I’ve become pretty good at quieting the distracting judgments that can arise in my mind while I am trying to write” (Brett Lott quoting Lauren Capone’s response to a survey, “So Great a Cloud of Witnesses,” Image, Number 69, Spring 2011, 82).

"Will ye also go away?" - C. H. Spurgeon
“Will ye also go away?”

— John 6:67

Many have forsaken Christ, and have walked no more with him; but what reason have YOU to make a change? Has there been any reason for it in the past? Has not Jesus proved himself all-sufficient? He appeals to you this morning—“Have I been a wilderness unto you?” When your soul has simply trusted Jesus, have you ever been confounded? Have you not up till now found your Lord to be a compassionate and generous friend to you, and has not simple faith in him give
