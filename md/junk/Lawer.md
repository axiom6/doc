On Dec. 7 2015 my landlord had my second car towed from its private parking garage and disposed of without providing any notice. I just discovered that my car was missing on Feb. 25, 2016 and filled out a police statement which the officer refused to file. The parking fees were up to date and the car had a valid parking sticker. Upon inquiry with the police and landlord I learned that the only cause was an expired registration assigned to my old address which the towing company made inquiries to without success, so I hold the landlord responsible. Therefore I need to know what the law says about a landlords notification obligations expire registration to file a successful lawsuit to recover:

1. The value of the car                $3000
2. Parking fees for breach of contract $2160
3. Court $200 and legal fees $1000     $1200 estimate.
                                       $6360 Total
