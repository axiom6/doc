Wish you well too. If you knew how much I hated the protestors in the late 60's my advocacy now is due to being fed up with GOP and feeling that I should have taken the gloves off sooner. In any case I don't feel that either one of us is that extreme, just outspoken in the election year.  Actually my initial Kasparov post was  2 days before yours and not specifically directed at you. Still need to explain how both communists and crony capitalists both play the middle class for suckers. I won't unfollow you right away, but I will keep my rebuttals short and only if I sense you are going off the rails. There maybe eventually be common but not in 2016.


Republicans - What is their philosophy?
              What is it good for?

Tom Flaherty Though I like Kasparov I find this commentary more applicable to Russia. Yes capitalism has lifted billions out poverty, but modern capitalism is a joke with the European Union, special interests, corporate welfare and a deregulated Wall Street that is allowed to hoist one Ponzi scheme after another. These malicious fools are what corrodes the economy and the human spirit.

Jim Flaherty Meanwhile,while I disagree with Sanders politically, I do see him a an honest man. Can anyone see Congress allowing him to enact his radical plans, radical in that they would require so many fundamenal changes ?

Tom Flaherty First yes, your terminology about Capitalism is more accurate, so then it is croney Capitalism that is playing out in the modern world.

Tom Flaherty Sanders is my candidate. What I like most are his views on Wall Street reform especially with getting banks out of the investment business. Canada maintained this approach and weathered the 2008 mortgage crisis better than any other country.

Jim Flaherty I do not disagree with how the entire mortgage market has been corrupted .... by government. Politicians have tried, quite successfully, to blame Wall Street. Which is frankly a crock of crap. The housing bubble began with government, and specifically the Clinton Admin, first suing banks for "discrimination", and then working out a deal by which the banks would make many more sub-prime (as in lousy credit) mortgages to minorities. The kicker was that Fannie and Freddie would underwrite these loans entirely, thus lifting the risks from the banks. This was about 1997, and I can provide links. We also have the fact that from 1992 to 1998, FF expanded its portfolio over 5-fold. The government became the biggest underwriter of mortgage loans, and lots of them were bad "subprime" loans. Under normal Capitalism, banks would never make these loans, and hadn't been, as the risk was too high. But Government, and the Clinton Admin in particular, wanted a political victory for minority housing, so they financed one huge win. Again, all of this is fact that can be easily verified. Andrew Cuomo, HUD Secretary, even admitted that these loans were far more risky. More to follow.

Jim Flaherty So now, by 2000, we have Fannie and Freddie underwriting over 40% of every home loan in America. Banks, and investment companies (now able to make mortgages), are able to write bad loans, with no risk of loss, as FF backed them all. And the bubble s...See More

Jim Flaherty If you research the repeal of Glass-Steagle, which allowed the merging of investment groups with banks, and thus further enabling the housing bubble, it is rooted in the merger of Traveler's Insurance and Citibank, to form Citigroup in 1998. This was the pet project of Robert Rubin, Clinton's Treasury Sec, who eventually ended up on the board of Citigroup when he left government. GS had to be repealed for the merger to happen. Rubin got it done. With bipartisan support.

Jim Flaherty By 2002, as writing mortgages seems a no lose situation, with no downside (yet), banks are not even bothering with FF anymore, and FF, which is essentially our government, begins to lose market share, as banks are writing loans that even FF would not have normally covered. So FF lowers its standards too. I blame Bush for letting this happen, although FF was run by Clinton appointees still, who reaped huge bonuses just for expanding the FF portfolios.

Jim Flaherty So now the bubble is full throttle. A few folks tried to issue the alarm, but there was too much money to be made. Those who were smart got out in time. Made a killing.

Jim Flaherty I am of the Milton Friedman school of "Greed is Good". Greed is a great motivator, and Capitalism relies on such. But it needs a free market, and not such as we saw with housing, where government underwrote the risk. The housing bubble never happens without Fannie and Freddie and their involvement in sub-primes. Never. But everyone blames Wall Street. Wall Street did what greed does, in a market corrupted by Government. It makes money.

Jim Flaherty Long version. I am not jumping on the blame wagon, as blame Bush, or blame Clinton. What I am asserting was that government is what enabled the housing bubble. That it never would have happened if not for government changing the dynamics of investment in the '90's for political reasons. Put another way, Clinton started it, and Bush did not stop it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpj4gcdm_JQ

Jim Flaherty Just past 3 minutes, you will hear the pophetic words of Cuomo. Behold the beginning of the sub-prime mortgage crisis. That $2.1 billion was fully financed by our government, via Fannie and Freddie. FF assumed the risk. Loans that never would have been made because the borrowers did not qualify.

Eric Adrignola The problem with Sanders, the part I find most troubling, is that he IS an honest man. He's a true believer in government power. The more government can do for the people, the better. He can't understand that it is that idea itself - motivated by all the best of intentions on his part - that is causing more problems than anything. Capitalism needs some regulation. But that doesn't mean the more regulation the better.

Donald Trump embodies how great republics meet their end

Jim Flaherty If not Trump, Cruz would be getting a lot of those votes. Point being, between the two, about 60% + of the GOP primary voters are clearly disappointed in the last 8 years of the GOP in Washington, and many even before that, as W Bush was not a big success story by any measure. Many folks want a wrecking ball, and Trump fits the mold. Goldwater was way ahead of his time, but he set the table for Reagan. Remember Dad worked locally for the Goldwater campaign ... smile emoticon Speaking of which, this is one of the greatest speeches of the 20th Century. RR at the GOP convention 1964. "A time for choosing".https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXBswFfh6AY
