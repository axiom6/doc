The all day Franken-meeting creeps up on you with Slack. 
You become a prisoner bombarded with chatter stuck in a virtual open office space. 
Chats go off topic, so channel designations become meaningless. 
In the end it is best to know when to collaborate and when to be alone 
for focused thinking and coding in the zone. 
I find Trello story boards more conducive to meaningful team collaboration.
