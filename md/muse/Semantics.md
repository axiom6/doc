In my methodology practices I leverage semantics like Business, Technology and Production to assist teams in staying context. Semantics focus that collaboration with meaningful vocabulary that produces good documentation. Often I am accused of putting teams in an ontological strait jacket 


SAM's functional formulations are good, but you are over reaching in asserting that without SAM your are making up the semantics of computing. My point is that generalized UI semantics like MVC start prescribing approaches that lead to opinionated frameworks with too much ceremony. This assessment is based on Angular1 projects where I saw my teams creating too much framework mandated boilerplate. So we refactored to RxJS and have not felt the need to add anything else for a year an half. 

RxJS like all the ReactiveX streams is reactive that supports life cycles. Sending a "car won't start" or better yet a car status message when the "battery is dead" is easy. 

As with any component we would implement a state machine as a set of RxJS subjects and attach them to our streams.

Upon reviewing SAM I see state machine semantics that fits an approach that your passionate about, so go with it. 

As this point I need to break of the conversation to engage in some political activism.
