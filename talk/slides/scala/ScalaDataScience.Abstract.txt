Title: Getting to Know Scala For Data Science

Abstract

Recently Scala has gained a lot of traction in Data Science with Apache Spark.

So what are Scala's success factors within a Data Science context?

First lets look at data:

Data loves Scala's strong typing for asserting its identity.
Data loves resilient packaging, wrapped under the covers by Scala's Monads.
Data loves a data driven world, which Scala accomplishes with Pattern Matching

More Data love:

Data loves to be promiscuous and not encapsulates by Objects, Scala' functional programming

Second let looks at the scientists:

Scientists love to alter reality, best accomplished by transforming data in Streams.
Scientists love things to happen all at once, Scala concurrency
Scientists love to have all their tools in one place with a multi-paradigm language on their desktop.

More Scientists love:

Scientists love to be prima-donnas

Data Scientists love to fondle data

So in this talk I will explore Scala's alignment to Data Science and then address the challenge's of
Scala's multi-paradigm capabilities with simple code constructs.

Note: C++ is also a multi-paradigm language and we know how that turned out, with only two peeple
in the world who know it all.
