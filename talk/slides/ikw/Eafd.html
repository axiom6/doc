All about Enterprise Architecture

Marketing today has evolved more into selling stories as a lifestyle, rather than the products and services themselves.

Every salesperson tells a story, and the good ones open with their exclusive. Enterprise Architecture exclusive is the story of bringing together business and technology as a single discipline.

The feature of combining business and technology enables the advantage of seeing the big picture with the benefit of making more informed decisions.

This is accomplished by starting with the premise that all organizations have a default Enterprise Architecture by the fact they are in operation. Rather or not it is documented and formal is another story. So the first step is simply harvesting the default documents.

The default Enterprise Architecture documentation is then divided into five groups: business, finance, technology, security and lifecycle and brought together under a single framework.  This framework connects all the various methodologies as a single Enterprise Architecture.

The final step is to select a number of opportunities to evaluate their risks and benefits in order to prioritize recommendations to senior management. This process is then periodically repeated.

The fifth and final model, lifecycle and maturity management, tells the story of how the Enterprise Architecture program is growing and how it is helping the business fulfill its mission and goals. This leads us back to the beginning of how Enterprise Architecture plays an important role in contributing to the story of business success.
