== [.black]#Definitions#

Machine Learning::
  Constructs algorithms that can learn from data.

Statistical Learning::
  A branch of applied statistics that emerged in response to machine learning.
  It emphasizes statistical models and assessment of uncertainty.

Data Science::
  The extraction of knowledge from data that leverages ideas from mathematics statistics machine learning computer science engineering...

Contrast::
  All of these displines are very similar with different emphases.


=== [.black .text-center]#Training Fitting Predictions#

Traditional Statistics::

* Domain experts work for 10 years to learn good features
* Then they bring the statistician a small clean dataset

Todays Approach::

* We start with a large dataset with many features.
* Then use a machine learning algorithm to find the good ones.
* A huge change.
