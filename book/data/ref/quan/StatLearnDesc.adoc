Restriction methods::
where we decide before-hand to limit the class
of functions. Additivity is an example, where we assume that our
model has the form ...
The size of the model is limited by the number of basis functions Mj
used for each component function fj .

Selection methods::
which adaptively scan the dictionary and include
only those basis functions hm that contribute significantly to the fit of
the model. Here the variable selection techniques discussed in Chapter
3 are useful. The stagewise greedy approaches such as CART,
MARS and boosting fall into this category as well.

Regularization methods::
where we use the entire dictionary but restrict
the coefficients. Ridge regression is a simple example of a regularization
approach, while the lasso is both a regularization and selection
method. Here we discuss these and more sophisticated methods
for regularization.

Piecewise Models::
