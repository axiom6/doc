## Supervised learning
* Generates a function that maps inputs to desired outputs. 
* One standard formulation of the supervised learning task is the
classification problem:
  * the learner is required to learn (to approximate the behavior
of a function which maps a vector into one of several classes by   
  * looking at several input-output examples of the function.

### Techniques
* Linear Classifiers
  * Logical Regression
  * Na√Øve Bayes Classifier
  * Perceptron
  * Support Vector Machine

* Quadratic Classifiers
* K-Means Clustering
* Boosting
* Decision Tree
  * Random Forest
* Neural networks
* Bayesian Networks


## Semi-supervised learning
* Combines both labeled and unlabeled examples to generate an appropriate function or classifier.
 
## Unsupervised learning
* Models a set of inputs: labeled examples are not available.


## Reinforcement learning
* Learns a policy of how to act given an observation of the world.
* Every action has some impact in the environment, and
* The environment provides feedback that guides the learning algorithm.

## Transduction
* Similar to supervised learning
* But does not explicitly construct a function: 
* Instead, tries to predict new outputs based on training inputs, training outputs, and new inputs.

## Learning to learn
* Learns its own inductive bias based onprevious experience.
