 Goedel’s Theorem shows us that there are many claims in mathematics that
 are true but whose truth we cannot know, at least not by mathematical proof
 (perhaps God can simply tell us that the claim is true, in which case we
 might have good reason to believe it, but we still wouldn’t know that it is true in the conventional mathematical sense of having a proof).

 In mathematics, we consider ourselves as knowing the axioms of a given mathematical
 theory—these are usually taken to be self-evident truths and they form a manageable
 set in the sense that we know whether any claim is or isn’t an axiom. Besides the
 axioms, we also consider ourselves as knowing the claims that follow via the rules
 of logic from those axioms. The axioms and their logical consequences are the claims
 that we can prove. Goedel’s Theorem states that there are always truths that are not
 knowable in this sense.

 Now one might say, well, if there are such truths, why don’t we just add them to our
 axioms. If we keep doing this, maybe we can render all mathematical truths provable
 in that way. But this strategy doesn’t work because Goedel’s Theorem shows that
 every time we add a new axiom, there’s a new “Goedel Sentence” that is true but not
 provable from the new axiom system.

 The key to proving Goedel’s Theorem is constructing what has come to be called a
 Goedel Sentence, which asserts (and the assertion is provably true!) that it is
 not provable within the axiom system under consideration. The Goedel Sentence is
 a self-referential statement, much like “This sentence is false.” By accurately
 asserting of itself that it is not provable, it ends up being true but not provable.
 This is a mindbender, but it works, and it shows that there will always be true
 mathematical statements that we cannot prove. This is the upshot of Goedel’s Theorem.

  Michael,

      I am glad you raised the question of Mathematical Truth because
I feel that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem provides the answer along
with insights on the limits of Knowledge and the roles of Wisdom and
Data Science.

    I may not have the the fully articulated answer, but this should be
a good start.

     First read https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del

     The key statement.

     "Gödel made an immense impact upon scientific and philosophical thinking in the 20th century,
a time when others such as Bertrand Russell,[3] A. N. Whitehead,[3] and David Hilbert
were analyzing the use of logic and set theory to understand the foundations of mathematics
pioneered by Georg Cantor."

    David Hilbert - A Key Figure for Mathematical Truth and MetaMathematics is cool.

   "Hilbert and his students contributed significantly to establishing rigor and developed important
 tools used in modern mathematical physics. Hilbert is known as one of the founders of proof theory
and mathematical logic, as well as for being among the first to distinguish between mathematics
and metamathematics.[4]"


  The basis for later theoretical computer science, in Alonzo Church and Alan Turing, also grew directly out of this 'debate'.
