==== [.black]#How It Works#

* Association rule implies that if an item A occurs, then item B also occurs with a certain probability.

* Most of the association rules generated are in the IF_THEN format.
  ** For example, IF people buy an iPad THEN they also buy an iPad Case to protect it.
  ** For the algorithm to derive such conclusions, it first observes the number of people who bought an iPad case while purchasing an iPad.
  ** This way a ratio is derived like out of the 100 people who purchased an iPad, 85 people also purchased an iPad case.


* If an item set occurs frequently then all the subsets of the item set, also occur frequently.
* If an item set occurs infrequently then all the supersets of the item set have infrequent occurrence.

==== [.black]#Benefits#

* It is easy to implement and can be parallelized easily.
* Apriori implementation makes use of large item set properties.

==== [.black]#Application#

* Detecting Adverse Drug Reactions

  ** Apriori algorithm is used for association analysis on healthcare data like-the drugs taken by patients, characteristics of each patient, adverse ill-effects patients experience, initial diagnosis, etc.
  ** This analysis produces association rules that help identify the combination of patient characteristics and medications that lead to adverse side effects of the drugs.

* Market Basket Analysis

  ** Many e-commerce giants like Amazon use Apriori to draw data insights on which products are likely to be purchased together and which are most responsive to promotion.
  ** For example, a retailer might use Apriori to predict that people who buy sugar and flour are likely to buy eggs to bake a cake.

* Auto-Complete Applications#

  ** Google auto-complete is another popular application of Apriori
  ** When the user types a word, the search engine looks for other associated words that people usually type after a specific word.
