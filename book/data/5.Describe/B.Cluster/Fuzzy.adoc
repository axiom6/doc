=== [.black]#Fuzzy C-Means#

* A case where each data point has fuzzy membership in more than one cluster
* Attempts to partition data points into a collection of c fuzzy clusters with respect to some given criterion

==== [.black]#Mathematics#

asciimath:[C = \sum _(i=1)^n \sum_(j=1)^c w_(ij)^m \abs(x_n-mu_j)^2]

asciimath:[w_(ij) = 1 / ( \sum _(k=1)^c ( abs( x_i - c_j ) / abs( x_i - c_k ) )^(2/(m-1))]


Where:
[horizontal]
C:: Clusters
n:: Number of data points
c:: Number of clusters
x~n~:: Vector for nth data point.
u~j~:: Geometric centroid for cluster.
w~ij~:: [0,1] Tells the degree to which x~i~ belongs to cluster c~j~
////

==== [.black]#Benefits#

* Gives best result for overlapped data set and comparatively better then k-means algorithm.
* Unlike k-means where data point must exclusively belong to one cluster center here data point is assigned
   membership to each cluster center as a result of which data point may belong to more then one cluster center.

==== [.black]#Drawbacks#

* Apriori specification of the number of clusters.
* With lower value of  Î² we get the better result but at the expense of  more number of iteration.
* Euclidean distance measures can unequally weight underlying factors
