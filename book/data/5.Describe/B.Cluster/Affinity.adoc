=== [.black]#Affinity#

* Creates clusters by sending messages between pairs of samples until convergence.

* A dataset is then described using a small number of exemplars, which are identified as those most representative of other samples.

* The messages sent between pairs represent the suitability for one sample to be the exemplar of the other, which is updated in response to the values from other pairs.

* This updating happens iteratively until convergence, at which point the final exemplars are chosen, and hence the final clustering is given.

==== [.black]#Benefits#
==== [.black]#Drawbacks#

* he main drawback of Affinity Propagation is its complexity.
* The algorithm has a time complexity of the order O(N^2 T),
* Further, the memory complexity is of the order O(N^2) if a dense similarity matrix is used, but reducible if a sparse similarity matrix is used.
* This makes Affinity Propagation most appropriate for small to medium sized datasets.
* A study comparing affinity propagation and Markov clustering on protein interaction graph partitioning found Markov clustering to work better for that problem

==== [.black]#Applications#

* Better for certain computer vision and computational biology tasks, e.g. clustering of pictures of human faces and identifying regulated transcripts, than k-means,[1] even when k-means was allowed many random restarts and initialized using PCA.[2]
