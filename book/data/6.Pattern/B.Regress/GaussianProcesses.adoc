Interpolates:: Observations can be interpolated (at least for regular correlation models).
Probabilistic:: The prediction is probabilistic (Gaussian) so that one can compute empirical confidence intervals and exceedence
probabilities that might be used to refit (online fitting, adaptive fitting) the prediction in some region of
interest.
Versatile:: Different linear regression models and correlation models can be specified. Common models are
provided, but it is also possible to specify custom models provided they are stationary.

==== [.black]#Drawbacks#
[horizontal]
Not Sparse:: It uses the whole samples/features information to perform the prediction.
Inefficent:: It loses efficiency in high dimensional spaces â€“ namely when the number of features exceeds a few dozens. It
might indeed give poor performance and it loses computational efficiency.
Post Classification::  Classification is only a post-processing, meaning that one first need to solve a regression problem by providing
the complete scalar float precision output y of the experiment one attempt to model.
