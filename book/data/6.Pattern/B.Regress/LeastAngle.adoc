=== [.black]#Least Angle#

* Least angle regression (LAR) can be viewed as a kind of “democratic” version
  of forward stepwise regression.

* LAR is intimately connected with the lasso, and in fact provides an extremely efficient algorithm for
  computing the entire lasso path

==== [.black]#How It Works#

* Forward stepwise regression builds a model sequentially, adding one variable
  at a time. At each step, it identifies the best variable to include in the
  active set, and then updates the least squares fit to include all the active
  variables.
* Least angle regression uses a similar strategy, but only enters “as much”
  of a predictor as it deserves.
