## Practices

Tied to the
road map to FEA for California in 2009 and to the Wisconsin Department of Transportation in 2013. In 2014 refined
Axiom's Practice Road Map with the Business Model Canvas for learning with Collaborate, Product and Discovery. In
2015 moved away from Agile processes to emphasize cultural Adaptation for Technology with Benefits. In 2015
conducted workshops for the Wisconsin Department of Transportation.

# NorTel

Developed & taught the Design Patterns & OO courses for BNRâ€™s switch developers at Bell Northern Research. The courses emphasized the
GOF and POSA Design Pattern catalogs applied to DMS-100 switch architecture. Authored an OO handbook that
described how to implement the best features of OO techniques. Saw an increase of productivity from my students.
