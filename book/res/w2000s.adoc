==== [.black]#UI/UX Applications# [.black .right]#Axiom &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;2010-2015#

Created UI/UX apps with refined JavaScript library managment, page navigation with REST / JSON interfaces.
The web technology stack included: CoffeeScript, Electron, RxJS, jQuery, Backboone, Visualization( D3, Leaflet, Mathbox, CSS3( Less,
Bootstrap ), Test( Jasmine, PhantomJS ) and PhoneGap for mobile. In 2014 I brought in RxJS to replace MVC with notification
driven publish and subscribe. Built REST servers in Akka and NodeJS. Leverage NodeJS with CommonJS for developement.

==== [.black]#Enterprise# [.black .right]#State of California&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;2009#

In 2008 my partners secured a contract with California's Health and Human services. We converted asset
data to the Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA) reference models (BRM SCRM, DRM, TCM, PRM). We then mapped
the FEA repository to Axiomâ€™s Practice Road Map, that made FEA accessible to all 13 health departments. To focus
on capital budgeting we replaced the PRM score cards with CPIC and added a quantitive platform in Pentaho BI that
our clients used to anticipate budget cuts.

==== [.black]#Symbolic Math# [.black .right]#Glaxo&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;2007-2008#

To learn Scala I recreated my symbolic math Lisp libraries into a Scala Math DSL (Domain Specific Language).
Math equations were writen in AsciiMath and parsed into Scala case classes for pattern matching transformions.
Tranformations included differentiation, some integraion, simplification, evaluation and MathML for typset
equations in browsers. Showed the Scala Math DSL to Glaxo and was awarded a contract for integrating symbolic math
into Glaxo's molecular modeling research.

==== [.black]#4-Tier B2B# [.black .right]#Axiom &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;2001-2006#

From 1996-2001 my teams and I had become proficient in J2EE with XML transactions.
So we leveraged our experience to build fully integrated portals. Started Axiom Architectures LLC in 2001
