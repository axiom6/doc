Since 1990 Axiom's 9 core practices have evolved from an innovative technology focus
to faclitating a collaborative culture that encourages productivity and creativity over process. A key enabler
is the hands on experience deriving benefits with each practice at Axiom, NREL, California, XCare,
DMR, Williams, NorTel and Glaxo. See: link:https://speakerdeck.com/axiom6/humanistic-practices[Humanistic Practices]

==== [.black]#Data Science Practices and NREL# [.black .right]#&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;2014-2016#

Defined a set of 10 data science practices at NREL. These practices provide a uniform approach to data science
by defining the context for clustering, dimensionality reduction, regression, model selection,
naive bayes, support vector machine and decision tree techniques. See: link:https://speakerdeck.com/axiom6/data-science-techniques[Data Science Practices]

|====
| Acquire  | The collection, refinement, schema model and preparation of data
| Desktop  | Tools for visualization, exploration, data access and notebooks
| Insight  | Hypothesis, statistics, ontology and the choices for analysis
| Describe | Insight with reports, profiles, clustering, dimensions and metadata
| Distill  | Discovers behavior patterns with regression and model generation
| Predict  | Classifies and projects patterns to determine future probelistic outcomes
| Advise   | Improves decisions with optimization and simulation
| Prove    | Diagnostics, algorithmic benchmarks and data archival for integrity and reproduction
| Process  | Streams, transforms and archives data with deplyed systems on the cloud
| Explain  | Measures assets and articulates decisions with teaching and publishing
