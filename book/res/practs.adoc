Since 1990 I have refined my methodology to 9 core practices have evolved from an innovative technology
focus to embracing a collaborative culture that encourages creativity over process. In the past these
practices incorporated Enterprise Architecture, Agile and Design Patterns. Over the course of my career
a key enabler has been the hands on experience and teaching on how to derive benefits with each practice at
University of North Texas, California, XCare, DMR, Williams, NorTel and Glaxo.

The 9 data science practices are a work in progress that I defined and briefly taught to the
IT group at the University of North Texas.
These practices provide a humanistic context to Augment the human experience.
Learning begins with Acquire, Domain Modeling and Insight that
the provide context for Machine Learning, Math Modeling and Interpretation. Shared results
are Proved and Explained to Advise our communities.

|====
| Acquire   | The collection, refinement and preparation of data as a shared resource
| Domain    | Tools, inquiries, schema and that form a working paradigm
| Insight   | Insight with intuition, theories, assessing uncertainty and choices
| Machine   | Guiding the training of machine learning techniques with feedback
| Model     | Cultivating statistical significant patterns based on math models
| Interpret | Measuring signal and assessing uncertainty to simulate future outcomes
| Prove     | Diagnosing and evaluating algorithms to protect and recreate results
| Explain   | Enriching the rationale and context behind findings
| Advise    | Harvesting interpretations, explanations and ethics to publish viable decisions
