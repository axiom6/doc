Regularize
  * Any modification we make to a learning algorithm that is intended to
    reduce its generalization error but not its training error

  Estimator
    * Works by trading increased bias for reduced variance
    * An effective regularizer is one that makes a profitable
      trade, reducing variance significantly while not overly increasing the bias.

  Generating
    * We are always trying to fit a square peg (the data generating process) into
      a round hole (our model family).

  Find
    * We almost always do findâ€”that the best fitting model (in the sense of minimizing
      generalization error) is a large model that has been regularized appropriately

  Parameter Norm Penalties
    * Penalizes only the weights
    * We do not induce too much variance by leaving the biases unregularized
    * Regularizing the bias parameters can introduce a significant amount of underfitting
