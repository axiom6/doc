<p>One recent indicator of success is that "reactive" has become an overloaded term and is now being associated with several different things to different people—in good company with words like "streaming," "lightweight," and "real-time."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From the perspective of this article, reactive is a set of design principles, a way of thinking about systems architecture and design in a distributed environment where implementation techniques, tooling, and design patterns are components of a larger whole—a system.</p>

<p>A reactive system is an architectural style that allows multiple individual applications to coalesce as a single unit, reacting to its surroundings, while remaining aware of each other—this could manifest as being able to scale up/down, load balancing, and even taking some of these steps proactively.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Functional reactive programming, commonly called FRP, is most frequently misunderstood. FRP was very precisely defined 20 years ago by Conal Elliott. The term has most recently been used incorrectly1 to describe technologies like Elm, Bacon.js, and Reactive Extensions (RxJava, Rx.NET, RxJS) amongst others. Most libraries claiming to support FRP are almost exclusively talking about reactive programming and it will therefore not be discussed further.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Reactive programming, not to be confused with functional reactive programming, is a subset of asynchronous programming and a paradigm where the availability of new information drives the logic forward rather than having control flow driven by a thread-of-execution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It supports decomposing the problem into multiple discrete steps where each can be executed in an asynchronous and non-blocking fashion, and then be composed to produce a workflow—possibly unbounded in its inputs or outputs.</p>

<h2 id="__span_class_black_asynchronous_programming_span"><span class="black">Asynchronous Programming</span></h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Asynchronous is defined by the Oxford Dictionary as “not existing or occurring at the same time,”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>which in this context means that the processing of a message or event is happening at some arbitrary time possibly in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is a very important technique in reactive programming since it allows for non-blocking execution</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>where threads of execution competing for a shared resource don’t need to wait by blocking (preventing the thread of execution from performing other work until current work is done),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and can as such perform other useful work while the resource is occupied. Amdahl’s Law2 tells us that contention is the biggest enemy of scalability, and therefore a reactive program should rarely, if ever, have to block.</p>

<dt class="hdlist1">Responsiveness Under Load</dt>
<dd>
<p>The throughput of a system scales up or down (as well as in or out) automatically to meet varying demand as resources are proportionally added or removed. It is the essential element needed to take advantage of the promises of cloud computing: allowing systems to be resource efficient, cost-efficient, environment-friendly and pay-per-use.</p>

<p>This is true whether we are running our systems on a single node (with multiple independent CPUs communicating over the QPI link) or on a cluster of nodes (with independent machines communicating over the network).</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Vertical and Horizontal Same</dt>
<dd>
<p>Embracing this fact means that there is no conceptual difference between scaling vertically on multicore or horizontally on the cluster. This decoupling in space [&#8230;&#8203;], enabled through asynchronous message-passing, and decoupling of the runtime instances from their references is what we call Location Transparency.</p>

<p>How does reactive programming relate to reactive systems?</p>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Reactive Programming</dt>
<dd>
<p>A great technique for managing internal logic and dataflow transformation, locally within the components, as a way of optimizing code clarity, performance and resource efficiency. Reactive systems, being a set of architectural principles, puts the emphasis on distributed communication and gives us tools to tackle resilience and elasticity in distributed systems.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Addressability</dt>
<dd>
<p>One common problem with only leveraging reactive programming is that its tight coupling between computation stages in an event-driven callback-based or declarative program makes resilience harder to achieve as its transformation chains are often ephemeral and its stages—the callbacks or combinators—are anonymous, i.e. not addressable.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Signaling</dt>
<dd>
<p>This means that they usually handle success or failure directly without signaling it to the outside world.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Escalationg</dt>
<dd>
<p>This lack of addressability makes recovery of individual stages harder to achieve as it is typically unclear where exceptions should, or even could, be propagated.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Tracing Failures</dt>
<dd>
<p>As a result, failures are tied to ephemeral client requests instead of to the overall health of the component—if one of the stages in the dataflow chain fails, then the whole chain needs to be restarted, and the client notified.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Self Healing</dt>
<dd>
<p>This is in contrast to a message-driven reactive system which has the ability to self-heal, without necessitating notifying the client.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Decouple In Time</dt>
<dd>
<p>Another contrast to the reactive systems approach is that pure reactive programming allows decoupling in time,
As mentioned, decoupling in time allows for concurrency,</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Decouple In Space</dt>
<dd>
<p>but not space (unless leveraging message-passing to distribute the dataflow graph under the hood, across the network, as discussed previously).
but it is decoupling in space that allows for distribution, and mobility—allowing for not only static but also dynamic topologies—which is essential for elasticity.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Location Transparency</dt>
<dd>
<p>A lack of location transparency makes it hard to scale out a program purely based on reactive programming techniques adaptively in an elastic fashion and therefore requires layering additional tools, such as a message bus, data grid, or bespoke network protocols on top.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Communication Abstraction</dt>
<dd>
<p>This is where the message-driven programming of reactive systems shines, since it is a communication abstraction that maintains its programming model and semantics across all dimensions of scale, and therefore reduces system complexity and cognitive overhead.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Callback Based</dt>
<dd>
<p>A commonly cited problem of callback-based programming is that while writing such programs may be comparatively easy, it can have real consequences in the long run.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Anonymous Callbacks</dt>
<dd>
<p>For example, systems based on anonymous callbacks provide very little insight when you need to reason about them, maintain them, or most importantly figure out what, where, and why production outages and misbehavior occur.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Addressable Components</dt>
<dd>
<p>Libraries and platforms designed for reactive systems (such as the Akka project and the Erlang platform) have long learned this lesson and are relying on long-lived addressable components that are easier to reason about in the long run.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Identifiable Components</dt>
<dd>
<p>When failures occurs, the component is uniquely identifiable along with the message that caused the failure. With the concept of addressability at the core of the component model, monitoring solutions have a meaningful way to present data that is gathered—leveraging the identities that are propagated.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Paradigm</dt>
<dd>
<p>The choice of a good programming paradigm, one that enforces things like addressability and failure management, has proven to be invaluable in production, as it is designed with the harshness of reality in mind, to expect and embrace failure rather than the lost cause of trying to prevent it.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Reactive Programming</dt>
<dd>
<p>All in all, reactive programming is a very useful implementation technique, which can be used in a reactive architecture. Remember that it will only help manage one part of the story: dataflow management through asynchronous and nonblocking execution—usually only within a single node or service.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Reactive System</dt>
<dd>
<p>Once there are multiple nodes, there is a need to start thinking hard about things like data consistency, cross-node communication, coordination, versioning, orchestration, failure management, separation of concerns and responsibilities etc.—i.e. system architecture.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Approach</dt>
<dd>
<p>Therefore, to maximize the value of reactive programming, use it as one of the tools to construct a reactive system.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Requires</dt>
<dd>
<p>Building a reactive system requires more than abstracting away OS-specific resources and sprinkling asynchronous APIs and circuit breakers on top of an existing, legacy, software stack.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Embrace</dt>
<dd>
<p>It should be about embracing the fact that you are building a distributed system comprising multiple services—that all need to work together, providing a consistent and responsive experience, not just when things work as expected but also in the face of failure and under unpredictable load.</p>
