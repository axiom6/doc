* Operators that transform items that are emitted by an Observable.

[horizontal]
Buffer::  Periodically gather items from an Observable into bundles and emit these bundles rather than emitting the items one at a time

FlatMap:: Transform the items emitted by an Observable into Observables, then flatten the emissions from those into a single Observable

GroupBy:: Divide an Observable into a set of Observables that each emit a different group of items from the original Observable, organized by key

Map::     Transform the items emitted by an Observable by applying a function to each item

Scan::    Apply a function to each item emitted by an Observable, sequentially, and emit each successive value

Window::  Periodically subdivide items from an Observable into Observable windows and emit these windows rather than emitting the items one at a time
