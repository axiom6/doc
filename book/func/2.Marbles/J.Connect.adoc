* Specialty Observables that have more precisely-controlled subscription dynamics

[horizontal]
Connect::  Instruct a connectable Observable to begin emitting items to its subscribers
Publish::  Convert an ordinary Observable into a connectable Observable
RefCount:: Make a Connectable Observable behave like an ordinary Observable
Replay::   Ensure that all observers see the same sequence of emitted items, even if they subscribe after the Observable has begun emitting items
