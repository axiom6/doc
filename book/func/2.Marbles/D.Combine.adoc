* Operators that work with multiple source Observables to create a single Observable

[horizontal]
And/Then/When:: Combine sets of items emitted by two or more Observables by means of Pattern and Plan intermediaries
CombineLatest:: When an item is emitted by either of two Observables, combine the latest item emitted by each Observable via a specified function and emit items based on the results of this function
Join::          Combine items emitted by two Observables whenever an item from one Observable is emitted during a time window defined according to an item emitted by the other Observable
Merge::         Combine multiple Observables into one by merging their emissions

StartWith::     Emit a specified sequence of items before beginning to emit the items from the source Observable
Switch::        Convert an Observable that emits Observables into a single Observable that emits the items emitted by the most-recently-emitted of those Observables

Zip::           Combine the emissions of multiple Observables together via a specified function and emit single items for each combination based on the results of this function
