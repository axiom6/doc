* A toolbox of useful Operators for working with Observables

[horizontal]
Delay::         Shift the emissions from an Observable forward in time by a particular amount
Do::            Register an action to take upon a variety of Observable lifecycle events
Materialize::   Represent both the items emitted and the notifications sent as emitted items, or reverse this process

Dematerialize:: Represent both the items emitted and the notifications sent as emitted items, or reverse this process

ObserveOn::     Specify the scheduler on which an observer will observe this Observable
Serialize::     Force an Observable to make serialized calls and to be well-behaved
Subscribe::     Operate upon the emissions and notifications from an Observable
SubscribeOn::   Specify the scheduler an Observable should use when it is subscribed to
TimeInterval::  Convert an Observable that emits items into one that emits indications of the amount of time elapsed between those emissions
Timeout::       Mirror the source Observable, but issue an error notification if a particular period of time elapses without any emitted items
Timestamp::     Attach a timestamp to each item emitted by an Observable
Using::         Create a disposable resource that has the same lifespan as the Observable
