== [.black]#Throttle#

* The throttle operator samples an asynchronous data stream by ignoring values
  that are followed by another value before the specified delay

* The throttle operator drops events that come in at too high a rate

* however, one can easily define other operators that aggregate events in (tumbling) windows or sample the input stream at certain intervals.
