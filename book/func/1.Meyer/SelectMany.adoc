== [.black]#Select Many#
* The SelectMany operator is often used to wire together two data streams.
* It takes a source stream  and an inflator function.
* Thenfrom each element in the original source stream it generates a new nested stream of zero, one, or more elements.
* It then merges all intermediate asynchronous data streams into a single output stream
* This produces a new asynchronous result stream.
