== [.black]#Switch#

* The Switch operator takes a nested asynchronous data stream

* It htne produces the elements of the most recent inner asynchronous data stream
  that has been received up to that point.

* This produces a new non-nested asynchronous data stream.

* It allows later streams to override earlier streams

* Always yielding the "latest possible results," rather like a scrolling news feed.
