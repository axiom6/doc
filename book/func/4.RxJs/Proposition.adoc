Asynchronous:: Can be very difficult to implement because existing programming
patterns donâ€™t scale to complex behavior

Callbacks and Promises:: Can be used to deal with asynchronous code, but have many
limitations when targeted against large streams generated from repeated button clicks
or mouse movements.

Reactive:: RxJS is a reactive solution that can more concisely and declaratively deal with large
amounts of data separated over time.

Propagation of Change:: RxJS requires seeing and understanding data in streams with
propagation of change.

Paradigm Shift:: RxJS elegantly combines both functional and reactive
paradigms into a simple computing model that places observables (streams) at the forefront.

Pipeline:: Streams are made up from a producer (observable), where data flows through a
pipeline, arriving at a consumer (observer). This same programming model is used
whether or not data is separated by time.

Observables:: Are pure and side effect free, with a powerful arsenal of operators and
transformations that will allow you compose your business logic with asynchronous operations
elegantly.
