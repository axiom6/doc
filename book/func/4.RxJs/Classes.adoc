Observable::   An invokable collection of future values or events.
Observer::     Collection of 3 callbacks: next(), error() and complete().
               That listen to values delivered by the Observable.
Subscription:: The execution of an Observable, is primarily useful for cancelling the execution.
Operators::    Pure functions that enable a functional programming style of dealing with collections with operations like map, filter, concat, flatMap, etc.
Subject::      The equivalent to an EventEmitter, and the only way of multicasting a value or event to multiple Observers.
Schedulers::   Centralized dispatchers to control concurrency, allowing us to coordinate when computation happens on e.g. setTimeout or requestAnimationFrame or others.
