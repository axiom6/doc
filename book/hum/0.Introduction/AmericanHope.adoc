That the American system worked so well astonished European visitors..

The French social and political theorist Alexis de Tocqueville says the vitality
of American associational live, along with the decentralized nature of the federal
system, at the keys to of the new democracy.

It was more remarkable that such a system should arisen in colonies populated by religious
refugees from a country that had abandoned its republican experiment in 1660.

As Tocqueville noted;

"whilst the hierarchy of rank [had] despotically classes the inhabitants of the mother country,
the American had presented the novel spectacle of a community homogeneous in all its parts".

It was this peculiarly egalitarian character of colonial society that had made possible
the uniquely dense network of civic associations which, Tocqueville agreed were the key
to the success of the American experiment. The country he described in Book II,
chapters 5 and 6, if his Democracy in America was, ite might be said the first networked
polity. "In no country in the world declared Tocqueville, "has the principle of association
been more successfully used of applied to a greater multitude of objects that in America",

"Besides the permanent associations which are established by law under the name of of townships,
cities and counties, a vast number of of others are formed and maintained by the agency of private
individuals. the citizen of the United States is taught form infancy to rely upon his own
exertions in order to resist the evils and the difficulties of life; he looks upon the
the social authority with an eye of mistrust and anxiety, and he claim its assistance only when
he is unable to to without it...

In the United States associations are established to promote the public safety, commerce,
industry, morality and religion. There is no end which the human will despairs of attaining
through the combined power of individuals united into a society."

Tocqueville saw America's political associations as an indispensable counterweight to danger of
tyranny that was inherent in modern democracy - if only the tyranny of the majority. However the
greatest strength of the American system, he argued, lay on in its non-political associations:

Americans of all ages, all conditions, all minds constantly unite. Not only do they have
commercial and industrial association in which all take part, but they also have a thousand
other kinds: religious, moral, grave, futile, very general and very particular, immense and
very small; Americans use association to give fetes, to found seminaries, to build inns,
to raise churches, to distribute books, to send missionaries to the antipodes; in this manner
they create hospitals, prisons, schools. Finally if is a question of bringing to light a truth
or developing a sentiment with the support of a great example, they associate."

The contrast with political and social structures of the his native France fascinated
Tocqueville. Why has the the revolution there located as it was in one of the crucial hubs
of the Enlightenment - produced result so disappointingly different?
