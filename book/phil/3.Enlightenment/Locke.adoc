    All that can fall within the compass of human understanding, being either, first,
    the nature of things, as they are in themselves, their relations, and their
    manner of operation: or, secondly, that which man himself ought to do, as a
    rational and voluntary agent, for the attainment of any end, especially happiness:
    or, thirdly, the ways and means whereby the knowledge of both the one and the other
     of these is attained and communicated; I think science may be divided properly into
     these three sorts.
    — Locke, 1823/1963, p. 174
