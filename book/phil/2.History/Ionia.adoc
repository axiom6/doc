=== [.black]#Advances in Greek Thought#

In the 6th century BC in archaic Greece, Ionia was home to a set of advances in scientific
thought, explanations on nature, and discovering the natural and rational causes behind
observable phenomena. This movement began on the Ionian coast of western Anatolia by small
numbers of forward-thinking Greeks  from cities such as Miletus, Samos, and Halicarnassus.
They saw the world as something ordered and intelligible, its history following an explicable
course and its different parts arranged in a comprehensible system. Most historians agree
that Thales, one of the Seven Sages of Greece, started this movement by predicting a solar
eclipse that actually occurred, though some believe this feat to be false.
