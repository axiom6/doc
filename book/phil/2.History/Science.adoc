=== [.black]#The Scientific Revolution#

The Scientific Revolution of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries changed the way educated people looked at
the world. It evolved from the Renaissance’s stress on the importance of individuals to understand the world
around them, and was the key factor that moved Europe from a worldview that was primarily religious to one
that was primarily secular. Although a more secular society was likely not their goal, Luther’s and Calvin’s
attacks against the authority of the pope provided a powerful example of how to challenge traditional authority.
Their questioning attitudes produced an environment that encouraged the inquiry necessary for science to flourish.
