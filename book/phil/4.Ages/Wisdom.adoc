=== [.black]#The Wisdom Age#

Wisdom or sapience is the ability to think and act using knowledge, experience,
understanding, common sense, and insight, especially in a mature or utilitarian
manner.[1] There appears to be consensus that wisdom is associated with attributes
such as compassion, experiential self-knowledge, non-attachment and virtues such as
ethics and benevolence.
