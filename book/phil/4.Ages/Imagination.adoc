=== [.black]#The Imagination Age#

The imagination age is a theoretical period beyond the information age where
creativity and imagination will become the primary creators of economic value.
This contrasts with the information age where analysis and thinking were the
main activities.[1][2] The concept holds that technologies like virtual reality,
user created content and YouTube will change the way humans interact with
each other and how they create economic and social structures. A key concept
is that the rise of the immersive virtual reality, the cyberspace or the
metaverse will raise the value of imagination work of designers, artists,
video makers and actors over rational thinking as a foundation of culture
and economics.
