<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the 6th century BC in archaic Greece, Ionia was home to a set of advances in scientific
thought, explanations on nature, and discovering the natural and rational causes behind
observable phenomena. This movement began on the Ionian coast of western Anatolia by small
numbers of forward-thinking Greeks  from cities such as Miletus, Samos, and Halicarnassus.
They saw the world as something ordered and intelligible, its history following an explicable
course and its different parts arranged in a comprehensible system. Most historians agree
that Thales, one of the Seven Sages of Greece, started this movement by predicting a solar
eclipse that actually occurred, though some believe this feat to be false.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Renaissance is a period in European history, covering the span between the 14th and 17th centuries.
It is an extension of the Middle Ages, and is bridged by the Age of Enlightenment to modern history.</p>

<h3 id="_the_scientific_revolution"><span class="black">The Scientific Revolution</span></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Scientific Revolution of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries changed the way educated people looked at
the world. It evolved from the Renaissance’s stress on the importance of individuals to understand the world
around them, and was the key factor that moved Europe from a worldview that was primarily religious to one
that was primarily secular. Although a more secular society was likely not their goal, Luther’s and Calvin’s
attacks against the authority of the pope provided a powerful example of how to challenge traditional authority.
Their questioning attitudes produced an environment that encouraged the inquiry necessary for science to flourish.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_scottish_enlightenment"><span class="black">The Scottish Enlightenment</span></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Scottish Enlightenment was the period in 18th and early 19th century Scotland characterised by an outpouring of intellectual and scientific accomplishments. By the eighteenth century, Scotland had a network of parish schools in the Lowlands and four universities. The Enlightenment culture was based on close readings of new books, and intense discussions took place daily at such intellectual gathering places in Edinburgh as The Select Society and, later, The Poker Club as well as within Scotland&#8217;s ancient universities (St Andrews, Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen).[1][2]</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sharing the humanist and rationalist outlook of the European Enlightenment of the same time period, the thinkers of the Scottish Enlightenment asserted the importance of human reason combined with a rejection of any authority that could not be justified by reason. In Scotland, the Enlightenment was characterised by a thoroughgoing empiricism and practicality where the chief values were improvement, virtue, and practical benefit for the individual and society as a whole.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Among the fields that rapidly advanced were philosophy, political economy, engineering, architecture, medicine, geology, archaeology, law, agriculture, chemistry and sociology. Among the Scottish thinkers and scientists of the period were Francis Hutcheson, David Hume, Adam Smith, Dugald Stewart, Thomas Reid, Robert Burns, Adam Ferguson, John Playfair, Joseph Black and James Hutton.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Scottish Enlightenment had effects far beyond Scotland, not only because of the esteem in which Scottish achievements were held outside Scotland, but also because its ideas and attitudes were carried all over Europe and across the Atlantic world as part of the Scottish diaspora, and by European and American students who studied in Scotland.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_american_enlightenment"><span class="black">The American Enlightenment</span></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The American Enlightenment was a period of intellectual ferment in the thirteen
American colonies in the 17th to 18th century, which led to the American Revolution,
and the creation of the American Republic. The American Enlightenment was influenced
by the 17th-century European Enlightenment and its own native American philosophy.
It applied scientific reasoning to politics, science, and religion.
It promoted religious tolerance. And, it restored literature, arts, and music as
important disciplines worthy of study in colleges. "New-model" American style
colleges were founded such as King&#8217;s College New York (now Columbia University),
and the College of Philadelphia (now Penn). Yale College and the College of
William &amp; Mary were reformed. A non-denominational moral philosophy replaced
theology in many college curricula. Even Puritan colleges such as the College of
New Jersey (now Princeton University) and Harvard University reformed their curricula
to include natural philosophy (science), modern astronomy, and mathematics.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Among the foremost representatives of the American Enlightenment were presidents of
colleges, including Puritan religious leaders Jonathan Edwards, Thomas Clap, and
Ezra Stiles, and Anglican moral philosophers Samuel Johnson and William Smith.
The leading political thinkers were John Adams, James Madison, Thomas Paine,
George Mason, James Wilson, Ethan Allen, and Alexander Hamilton, and polymaths
Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson. Leading scientists included Benjamin Franklin
for his work on electricity, William Smith for his organization and observations of
the Transit of Venus, Jared Eliot for his work in metallurgy and agriculture, the
astronomer David Rittenhouse in astronomy, math, and instruments, Benjamin Rush in
medical science, Charles Willson Peale in natural history, and Cadwallader Colden for
his work in botany and town sanitation. Colden&#8217;s daughter, Jane Colden, was the first
female botanist working in America. Count Rumford was a leading scientist, especially
in the field of heat.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Just as the Enlightenment reached its peak, its positive influence began
to decline beginning with the French Revolution and then continuing with the
the Napoleonic wars, the British Empire, the American Civil War,
The First and Second Industrial Ages, World Wars I and II, to the recent
loss of potential of the Information Age due to smart phone addiction.</p>

<h3 id="_the_information_age"><span class="black">The Information Age</span></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Information Age (also known as the Computer Age, Digital Age, or New Media Age) is
a 21st century period in human history characterized by the rapid shift from
traditional industry that the Industrial Revolution brought through industrialization,
to an economy based on information technology. The onset of the Information Age is
associated with the Digital Revolution, just as the Industrial Revolution marked the
onset of the Industrial Age. The definition of what digital means (or what
information means) continues to change over time as new technologies, user devices,
methods of interaction with other humans and devices enter the domain of research,
development and market launch.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During the Information Age, the phenomenon is that the digital industry creates an
informed society surrounded by a high-tech global economy that spans over its
influence on how the manufacturing throughout and the service sector operate in an
efficient and convenient way. In a commercialized society, the information industry is
able to allow individuals to explore their personalized needs, therefore simplifying
the procedure of making decisions for transactions and significantly lowering costs
for both the producers and buyers. This is accepted overwhelmingly by participants
throughout the entire economic activities for efficacy purposes, and new economic
incentives would then be indigenously encouraged, such as the knowledge economy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Information Age formed by capitalizing on computer microminiaturization advances.
This evolution of technology in daily life and social organization has led to the fact
that the modernization of information and communication processes have become the
driving force of social evolution.</p>

<h5 id="_tim_berners_lee"><span class="black">Tim Berners Lee</span></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The idea is simple: re-decentralize the Web. Working with a small team of
developers, he spends most of his time now on Solid, a platform designed
to give individuals, rather than corporations, control of their own data.
“There are people working in the lab trying to imagine how the Web could
be different. How society on the Web could look different. What could
happen if we give people privacy and we give people control of their data,”
Berners-Lee told me. “We are building a whole eco-system.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For now, the Solid technology is still new and not ready for the masses.
But the vision, if it works, could radically change the existing power
dynamics of the Web. The system aims to give users a platform by which
they can control access to the data and content they generate on the Web.
This way, users can choose how that data gets used rather than, say,
Facebook and Google doing with it as they please. Solid’s code and
technology is open to all—anyone with access to the Internet can come
into its chat room and start coding. “One person turns up every few days.
Some of them have heard about the promise of Solid, and they are driven to
turn the world upside down,” he says. Part of the draw is working with
an icon. For a computer scientist, coding with Berners-Lee is like playing
guitar with Keith Richards. But more than just working with the inventor
of the Web, these coders come because they want to join the cause.
These are digital idealists, subversives, revolutionaries, and anyone else
who wants to fight the centralization of the Web. For his part, working on
Solid brings Berners-Lee back to the Web’s early days: “It’s under the radar,
but working on it in a way puts back some of the optimism and excitement that
the ‘fake news’ takes out</p>

<h3 id="_the_knowledge_age"><span class="black">The Knowledge Age</span></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Knowledge is a familiarity, awareness, or understanding of someone or something, such
as facts, information, descriptions, or skills, which is acquired through experience
or education by perceiving, discovering, or learning.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Knowledge can refer to a theoretical or practical understanding of a subject.
It can be implicit (as with practical skill or expertise) or explicit
(as with the theoretical understanding of a subject); it can be more or less formal
or systematic.[1] In philosophy, the study of knowledge is called epistemology;
the philosopher Plato famously defined knowledge as "justified true belief", though
this definition is now thought by some analytic philosophers[citation needed] to be
problematic because of the Gettier problems while others defend the platonic definition.[2] However, several definitions of knowledge and theories to explain it exist.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Knowledge acquisition involves complex cognitive processes: perception, communication,
and reasoning; while knowledge is also said to be related to the capacity of
acknowledgement in human beings.</p>

<h3 id="_the_wisdom_age"><span class="black">The Wisdom Age</span></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Wisdom or sapience is the ability to think and act using knowledge, experience,
understanding, common sense, and insight, especially in a mature or utilitarian
manner.[1] There appears to be consensus that wisdom is associated with attributes
such as compassion, experiential self-knowledge, non-attachment and virtues such as
ethics and benevolence.</p>
