All of these Design Thinking techniques are distributed cognition techniques that:

* Move memory out of your head into the world, freeing up processing power.

* Allow you to see connections and relationships you can’t easily visualize in your head.

* Create a shared understanding for teams. Now your team can be part of that distributed world you think with.

Problem Areas:

Context analysis::
Interviews, empathy, contextual inquiry, listening sessions, diary studies as all tools for
getting a fresh understanding of the context in which one will be designing. And there are way more.

Sensemaking::
When you have too many ideas, too much information, how do you find insights?
Well, there are always Post-its. See Needfinding for Disruptive Innovation.

Idea generation::
Mature designers know that even if your first idea is brilliant, you’ll never know unless
you come up with 20 more. Sprints and Charettes are techniques for finding and
refining potential solutions.

Product definition:: Conceptual models, sitemaps, flowcharts, wireflows, use cases,
user stories… so many ways to ask engineers to “build this.”

Idea Validation::
Part of thinking with the world is working with the world of users.
From participatory design to usability testing, effective designers
find ways to evaluate the quality of their thinking with the people
who really pay the bills: customers

“Design makes ideas tangible so that they can be understood and evaluated before committing them to reality.”

Design work is two kinds of world modeling work:

    Modeling the world as it is.
    Modeling the world as it could be.
