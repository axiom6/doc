        Empiricism: do things based on evidence, experiment, test your assumptions and be prepared to re-evaluate knowledge based on new experience.
        Effectiveness: extends beyond just efficiency to consider the bigger picture and the impact of actions, both now and in the future.
        Transparency: assure that things are out in the open, visible and understandable to those who need to know or are affected. Make information available and understandable for everyone unless there is a good reason for confidentiality.
        Continuous improvement: learn from what you’ve done to do better in the future.
        Accountability: take care of things. Take ownership of responsibilities and for the overall objectives of the organization. Do what you’ve agreed to. Clean up your own mess!
        Equivalence: people affected by decisions are involved in making them, with the power to influence change when there is reason to do so (equivalence is important precisely because people are otherwise often not equal in their ability to influence).
        Consent: do things in the absence of reasons not to do them. Aim for "good enough for now and safe enough to try" decisions and improve as it becomes obvious how to do so (supremacy lies with the argument, not a person!).
