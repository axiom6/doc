## Forms of Conscienceness

Sensory experience::       "the phenomenal sense that something exists in relation to, or has an impact on, a person". The concept of ‘affect’ attests to this kind of consciousness, as does ‘sense data' "
Practical consciousness::  "knowing how to do things, knowing how to ‘go on’. As writers as different as Wittgenstein and Marx have elaborated, it is "basic to human engagement"
Reflective consciousness:: "the modality in which people reflect upon the first two forms. It is the stuff of ordinary philosophy and day-to-day thinking about what has been done and what is to be done"
Reflexive consciousnessv:: "reflecting on the basis of reflection, and interrogating the nature of knowing in the context of the constitutive conditions of being".
