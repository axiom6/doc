Noah, I have been thinking about you so it is great to hear from you.
When I next come down to Denver I will arrange to meet with you.
 I am very interested in reviewing the ALPHA version of the monster?
  In fact I am confident that I provide context to help you edit it
  to make it less of a monster while retaining all the good stuff.
  My experience is that initially a thesis in Zachman starts out as
  an artifact pile in order to achieve the comprehensiveness that
  Zachman is awesome at.
  The artifact pile can be distilled down to its essential meaning
  which I know you have with your Network background and cognitive
  abilities being the son of psychologists.

  I can provide the confidence to get past the need to impress with
  innovation (People, Function, Data and Network) and make the
  connection (Motivation) to your thesis audience.

  God I love how anything can be expressed in Zachman vocabulary.
