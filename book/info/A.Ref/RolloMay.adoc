Stages of development

Like Freud, May defined certain "stages" of development. These stages are not as strict as Freud's psychosexual stages, rather they signify a sequence of major issues in each individual's life:

    Innocence – the pre-egoic, pre-self-conscious stage of the infant: An innocent is only doing what he or she must do. However, an innocent does have a degree of will in the sense of a drive to fulfill needs.
    Rebellion – the rebellious person wants freedom, but does not yet have a good understanding of the responsibility that goes with it.
    Ordinary – the normal adult ego learned responsibility, but finds it too demanding, so seeks refuge in conformity and traditional values.
    Creative – the authentic adult, the existential stage, self-actualizing and transcending simple egocentrism

The stages of development that Rollo May set out are not stages in the conventional sense (not in the strict Freudian sense) i.e. a child may be innocent, ordinary or creative at any given time. An adult can also be rebellious as the expression "mid-life crisis" suggests (Ellis & Abrams,2009).[8]




    Libido : Biological function that can be satisfied through sexual intercourse or some other release of sexual tension.
    Eros : Psychological desire the seeks procreation or creation through an enduring union with a loved one.
    Philia : intimate non-sexual friendship between two people.
    Agape: esteem for the other, the concern for the other’s welfare beyond any gain that one can get out of it, disinterested love, typically, the love of God for man.
    Manic : Impulsive, emotionally driven love. Feelings are very hot and cold. The relationship transitions between thriving and perfect, or bitter and ugly.
