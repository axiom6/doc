[horizontal]
Premise::                Chance favors the connected mind.
Adjacent&nbsp;Possible:: Possibilities emerge and become close waiting to connected.
Slow&nbsp;Hunches::      Ideas evolve over time as slow hunches rather than sudden breakthroughs.
Technologies::           Technologies engineered for one purpose are extended other purposes.
Large&nbsp;Networks::    Allows ideas to be diffused and be reconnected in novel ways,
Collaboration::          Discoveries have gravitated away from individuals and towards teams.
Connections::            Random connections drive serendipitous discoveries
Shared Space::           Ideas converge in a shared physical or intellectual space.
Errors::                 Learning that forces us to adopt new strategies and to abandon our old assumptions.
Repurposing::            New uses found current and old platforms.

Premise::                Lots of connections as illustrated by the color coded rectangles.
Adjacent&nbsp;Possible:: Interelated tiers represented by hexagons have adjacent sides with meaning.
Slow&nbsp;Hunches::      Time and resources are alocated to evolve each practice.
Platforms::              Each practice serves as a large extensible multi-tier platform.
Large&nbsp;Networks::    Each tier is part of a large network.
Collaboration::          The Product Entitlement tier captures messages from the Collaborate practice
Connections::            Random collaborative connection are source
Shared Space::           Each practice is functions as a share physical and intellectual space.
Errors::                 When iterate with prototypes to recognize and learn from our errors.
Repurposing::            Each practice is built on a core foundation for new purposes.
