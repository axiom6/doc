=== [.black]#Three Columns#
[horizontal]
Embrace::   A tactical approach for human colaboration and adapting to change.

Encourage:: A shared strategic vision for discovery, benefits  governed by principles.

=== [.black]#Three Rows#
[horizontal]
Learn:: A collaborative means for conceiving products and discovering thier connection to customers.
Do::    Technological adaptatiion and construction influenced by it benefits.
Share:: Continuous change and delivery overseen by governance.

=== [.black]#Nine Practices#

Practices emerge at the intersections of columns and rows
Practices focus the principles of its column and row.

[horizontal]
Collaborate:: A charter driven proactive multi-faceted team response to requests with Kanban.
Product::     Entitling our teams to transform propositions into an attractive well documented portfolio.
Discovery::   Finding and connecting our vision to our community with valid assumptions.
Adapt::       Fine tuning our work by insuring that our components provide acceptable features.

=== [.black]#Twelve Connections between Nine Practices#

* The six horizontal connections convey culture across columns.
* The six vertical connections flow successive refinements down rows.
  ** The innovative flows from Product to Technology to Deliver are further
     broken out into a group of three.

////
These working concepts are expressed in the following practices where
moving across the columns promotes cultural fit and moving down the rows
provides perspectives for successive refinements.

* The rest of this document discusses the inspiration and principles behind
  each column and row.

* The subsequent document descrives each of the nine practices.
