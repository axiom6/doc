=== [.black]#A Humanistic Approach#

"The Collaboration, Innovation & Encouragement from Open Source communities is
the 21st century enlightenment that everyone is entitled too."

When I Tweeted this on August 29, 2017 I finally realized what
Humanistic Practices is all about.

* "Everyone is entitled too Collaborate in a safe environment to make their contributions."

* "Everyone has the capacity to Innovate. It is what makes us human."

* "As we travel on our journey we need to accept and provide Encouragement for Enlightenment."

* "Get in with a good crowd with a capacity for change and a sense of purpose in a good situation."

At first this may appear to be religious text, but this philosophy is what inspires the Open Source
community at GitHub.

=== [.black]#GitHub - The largest open source community in the world#

As of March 17, 2017 there are 27 million people with 57 open source reposities on GitHub.
Join one or start your own.

Shape the future of software::
Your contributions help make technology better for everyone, developers and non-developers alike.

Grow your skills and help others::
Whatever your skill level, working on open source software is a great way to learn new things.

Work with the best in the field::
Amazing developers use GitHub. Contribute code to projects that change how software is built.

=== [.black]#What Can we Learn from Millions of People#

We learn that great things have happened, are happening and will continue to happen.

* Your Collaborative contribution is valued and sought after.
* You can learn and share new Innovative skills.
* The best people are out their to Encourage and be Encouraged.

But most important their are millions of people who are experiencing this 21st Century Enlightenment.

=== [.black]#Twelve Connections between Nine Practices#

* The six horizontal connections convey culture across columns.
* The six vertical connections flow successive refinements down rows.
  ** The innovative flows from Product to Technology to Deliver are further
     broken out into a group of three.

////
These working concepts are expressed in the following practices where
moving across the columns promotes cultural fit and moving down the rows
provides perspectives for successive refinements.

* The rest of this document discusses the inspiration and principles behind
  each column and row.

* The subsequent document descrives each of the nine practices.
