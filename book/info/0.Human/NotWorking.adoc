=== [.black]#What Does Not Work#

The twentieth century saw the fullfillment of the industrial age and the birth of the
information age. However managerial practices are still mired in the industrial practices
of control and process with vague incentives that people don't relate to.

Managerial control maintained by process is driven by a lack of confidence rather than a passion for
team contribution, product innvation and discovery. The higher asperations of interaction, creativity and
understanding are pushed aside by project milestones, rigid requirements and unexamined assumptions.

There are no:

* Magic silver bullet processes.
* Procedures that drive high functioning teams.
* Project milestones that produce accomplishments.
* Performance measures that motivate.
